This repository is to look into three years of Iowa Liquor Sales (2019-2021). The shareholders for this project wanted to know the following...
- How much liquor was sold($) per year
- What were the top selling items by sales($) and by volume(L)
- What counties sold the most liquor
- What type of alcohol(whiskey, gin, vodka, etc...) was most popular

The data comes from https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy and contains all spirit purchase information of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees. 

Class "E" liquor license, for grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores, etc., allows commercial establishments to sell liquor for off-premises consumption in original unopened containers.

Data was cleaned, processed, and transformed using SQLiteStudio and then imported into Tableau for visuals.
